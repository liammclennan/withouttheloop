A colleague asked about learning how to use OKRs (objectives and key results), so I'm re-posting here (waste not).

Here is my approach to learning OKRs:

1. Watch [John Doerr's TED Talk 'Why the Secret to Success is Setting the Right Goals](https://www.ted.com/talks/john_doerr_why_the_secret_to_success_is_setting_the_right_goals?language=en#t-692734)

1. Listen to [a summary of John's book 'Measure What Matters'](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/you-exec-book/measure-what-matters-by-john-VoLRAtzgaD2/)

1. Read ['Measure What Matters'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39286958-measure-what-matters)

# Additional Thought's on OKR Usage

* OKRs are a tool for empowering individuals/teams. The people closest to the problem are empowered to find the best solution, instead of being given instructions. 
* People/teams negotiate their own OKRs. They are not imposed. 
* OKRs are an evolution of Drucker's [Management by Objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives)
* Less is more. OKRs help with focus and de-prioritization.
* Should be publically (within the organisation) visible.
* Must not be linked to pay/bonuses because it perverts the process. Failure must be allowed and expected. In this way it is different to management by objectives. 
* Provides the basis for strategic planning. Issue trees and impact mapping can pickup from OKRs.
