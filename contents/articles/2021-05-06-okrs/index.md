A colleague asked about learning how to use OKRs (objectives and key results), so I'm re-posting here (waste not).

Here's my approach to learning OKRs:

## Step 1: Watch [John Doerr's TED Talk 'Why the Secret to Success is Setting the Right Goals](https://www.ted.com/talks/john_doerr_why_the_secret_to_success_is_setting_the_right_goals?language=en#t-692734)

## Step 2: Listen to [a summary of John's book 'Measure What Matters'](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/you-exec-book/measure-what-matters-by-john-VoLRAtzgaD2/)

## Step 3: Read ['Measure What Matters'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39286958-measure-what-matters)

# Additional Thought's on OKR Usage

1. OKRs are a tool for empowering individuals/teams. The people closest to the problem are empowered to find the best solution, instead of being given instructions. 
1. People/teams negotiate their own OKRs. They are not imposed. 
1. OKRs are an evolutions of Drucker's [Management by Objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives)
1. Less is more. OKRs help with focus and de-prioritization.
1. Should be publically (within an organisation) visible.
1. Must not be linked to pay/bonuses because it perverts the process. Failure must be allowed and expected. In this way it is different to management by objectives. 
1. Provides the basis for strategic planning. Issue trees and impact mapping can pickup from OKRs.
